# Hospital Data Extraction

## Overview

Hospital Data Extraction is a project designed to extract specific data from a collection of hospital records or databases. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pattern matching algorithms to parse through textual data and identify relevant information such as patient demographics, medical history, diagnoses, and treatments.

## Features

- Extract patient demographics (e.g., name, age, gender)
- Retrieve medical history and past treatments
- Identify current diagnoses and prescribed medications
- Parse doctor's notes and clinical reports
- Generate structured data from unstructured text

## Usage

To use the Hospital Data Extraction system:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/VIGNESH-PROJECTWORK/chatbot-2.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd chatbot-2

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

   python data_extraction.py

   Follow the instructions provided to input hospital records or textual data and extract the desired information.

## Results

The performance of the Hospital Data Extraction system is evaluated based on its accuracy in extracting relevant data from hospital records. The extracted data can be further processed for analysis, reporting, or integration with other healthcare systems.
